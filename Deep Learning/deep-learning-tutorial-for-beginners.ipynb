    "* Well, now we know what is our cost that is error.\n",
    "* Therefore, we need to decrease cost because as we know if cost is high it means that we make wrong prediction.\n",
    "* Lets think first step, every thing starts with initializing weights and bias. Therefore cost is dependent with them.\n",
    "* In order to decrease cost, we need to update weights and bias.\n",
    "* In other words, our model needs to learn the parameters weights and bias that minimize cost function. This technique is called gradient descent.\n",
    "* Lets make an example:\n",
    "    * We have w = 5 and bias = 0 (so ignore bias for now). Then we make forward propagation and our cost function is 1.5.\n",
    "    * It looks like this. (red lines)\n",
    "    <a href=\"http://imgbb.com/\"><img src=\"http://image.ibb.co/dAaYJH/7.jpg\" alt=\"7\" border=\"0\"></a>\n",
    "    * As you can see from graph, we are not at minimum point of cost function. Therefore we need to go through minimum cost. Okey, lets update weight. ( the symbol := is updating)\n",
    "    * w := w - step. The question is what is this step? Step is slope1. Okey, it looks remarkable. In order to find minimum point, we can use slope1. Then lets say slope1 = 3 and update our weight. w := w - slope1 => w = 2.\n",
    "    * Now, our weight w is 2. As you remember, we need to find cost function with forward propagation again. \n",
    "    * Lets say according to forward propagation with w = 2, cost function is 0.4. Hmm, we are at right way because our cost function is decrease. We have new value for cost function that is cost = 0.4. Is that enough? Actually I do not know lets try one more step.\n",
    "    * Slope2 = 0.7 and w = 2. Lets update weight w : = w - step(slope2) => w = 1.3 that is new weight. So lets find new cost.\n",
    "    * Make one more forward propagation with w = 1.3 and our cost = 0.3. Okey, our cost even decreased, it looks like fine but is it enough or do we need to make one more step? The answer is again I do not know, lets try.\n",
    "    * Slope3 = 0.01 and w = 1.3. Updating weight w := w - step(slope3) => w = 1.29 ~ 1.3. So weight does not change because we find minimum point of cost function. \n",
    "    * Everything looks like good but how we find slope? If you remember from high school or university, in order to find slope of function(cost function) at given point(at given weight) we take derivative of function at given point. Also you can ask that okey well we find slope but how it knows where it go. You can say that it can go more higher cost values instead of going minimum point. The asnwer is that slope(derivative) gives both step and direction of step. Therefore do not worry :)\n",
    "    * Update equation is this. It says that there is a cost function(takes weight and bias). Take derivative of cost function according to weight and bias. Then multiply it with  α learning rate. Then update weight. (In order to explain I ignore bias but these all steps will be applied for bias)\n",
    "    <a href=\"http://imgbb.com/\"><img src=\"http://image.ibb.co/hYTTJH/8.jpg\" alt=\"8\" border=\"0\"></a>\n",
    "    * Now, I am sure you are asking what is learning rate that I mentioned never. It is very simple term that determines learning rate. Hovewer there is tradeoff between learning fast and never learning. For example you are at Paris(current cost) and want to go Madrid(minimum cost). If your speed(learning rate) is small, you can go Madrid very slowly and it takes too long time. On ther other hand, if your speed(learning rate) is big, you can go very fast but maybe you make crash and never go to Madrid. Therefore, we need to choose wisely our speed(learning rate).\n",
    "    * Learning rate is also called hyperparameter that need to be chosen and tuned. I will explain it more detailed in artificial neural network with other hyperparameters. For now just say learning rate is 1 for our previous example.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* I think now you understand the logic behind forward propagation(from weights and bias to cost) and backward propagation(from cost to weights and bias to update them). Also you learn gradient descent. Before implementing the code you need to learn one more thing that is how we take derivative of cost function according to weights and bias. It is not related with python or coding. It is pure mathematic. There are two option first one is to google how to take derivative of log loss function and second one is even to google what is derivative of log loss function :) I choose second one because I cannot explain math without talking :) \n",

    "* It is also called deep neural network or deep learning.\n",
    "* **What is neural network:** It is basically taking logistic regression and repeating it at least 2 times.\n",
    "* In logistic regression, there are input and output layers. However, in neural network, there is at least one hidden layer between input and output layer.\n",
    "* **What is deep, in order to say \"deep\" how many layer do I need to have:** When I ask this question to my teacher, he said that \"\"Deep\" is a relative term; it of course refers to the \"depth\" of a network, meaning how many hidden layers it has. \"How deep is your swimming pool?\" could be 12 feet or it might be two feet; nevertheless, it still has a depth--it has the quality of \"deepness\". 32 years ago, I used two or three hidden layers. That was the limit for the specialized hardware of the day. Just a few years ago, 20 layers was considered pretty deep. In October, Andrew Ng mentioned 152 layers was (one of?) the biggest commercial networks he knew of. Last week, I talked to someone at a big, famous company who said he was using \"thousands\". So I prefer to just stick with \"How deep?\"\"\n",
    "* **Why it is called hidden:** Because hidden layer does not see inputs(training set)\n",
    "* For example you have input, one hidden and output layers. When someone ask you \"hey my friend how many layers do your neural network have?\" The answer is \"I have 2 layer neural network\". Because while computing layer number input layer is ignored. \n",
    "* Lets see 2 layer neural network: \n",
    "<a href=\"http://ibb.co/eF315x\"><img src=\"http://preview.ibb.co/dajVyH/9.jpg\" alt=\"9\" border=\"0\"></a>\n",
    "* Step by step we will learn this image.\n",
    "    * As you can see there is one hidden layer between input and output layers. And this hidden layer has 3 nodes. If yoube curious why I choose number of node 3, the answer is there is no reason, I only choose :). Number of node is hyperparameter like learning rate. Therefore we will see hyperparameters at the end of artificial neural network.\n",
    "    * Input and output layers do not change. They are same like logistic regression.\n",
    "    * In image, there is a tanh function that is unknown for you. It is a activation function like sigmoid function. Tanh activation function is better than sigmoid for hidden units bacause mean of its output is closer to zero so it centers the data better for the next layer. Also tanh activation function increase non linearity that cause our model learning better.\n",
    "    * As you can see with purple color there are two parts. Both parts are like logistic regression. The only difference is activation function, inputs and outputs.\n",
    "        * In logistic regression: input => output\n",
    "        * In 2 layer neural network: input => hidden layer => output. You can think that hidden layer is output of part 1 and input of part 2.\n",
    "* Thats all. We will follow the same path like logistic regression for 2 layer neural network.\n",
